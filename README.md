open-recursor-check
===================

Tools to check network ranges for open recursive DNS servers.
An example of the scripts' output can be seen at 
http://ormon.funkfeuer.at/


Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

- python 2.6 or higher
- python-json
- rrdtool

These scripts were tested on Debian squeeze (6.0.7).


Preparations
------------

First create the RRD database:

	$ ./init.sh


Configuration 
------------
Then specify the IP ranges which should be scanned:

	$ vi  scan-my-net.py

Example:

	ranges=["192.168.0.0/24","10.0.0.0/16"]

Change the ranges to your needs.


Testing 
------------
Make a test run:
  $ ./scan-my-net.py
 
This should give you an output similar to:

	akaplan@0xffshell:~/openrecursors/scanning$ ./scan-funkfeuer.py
	[<ip.Range instance at 0x24174d0>, <ip.Range instance at 0x2417320>]
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.0, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.1, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.2, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.3, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.4, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.5, result:False
	test:DNS Recursor, ip: 193.238.156.6, result:False

Terminate the scan with `Ctrl-C` or `Ctrl-Z` and `kill %1`.

If you see some error messages, there is something wrong with your python setup.


Permanent installation
----------------------
Add scan-my-net.py to your crontab:

	0  3  *   *   *     ( /home/akaplan/openrecursors/scanning/doit.sh  > /dev/null )

(change the paths according to your installation)


Test the graphs
---------------
init.sh can generate the graphs based on the RRD data.
Symlink the graphs to your webservers' DocumentRoot. Now you can see them online.


Open issues and further research
================================

1) Currently, the init.sh file re-creates the .rrd database completely and
   re-plots every RRD graph. This is inefficient.

2) Scanning the network should be done in parallel. Look at [zmq](http://www.zeromq.org/) and related 
   technologies for parallelizing this.
